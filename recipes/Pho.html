    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>4 pounds beef soup bones (shank and knee)</ul>
        <ul>1 medium onion, unpeeled and cut in half</ul>
        <ul>5 slices fresh ginger</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon salt</ul>
        <ul>2 pods star anise</ul>
        <ul>2 ½ tablespoons fish sauce</ul>
        <ul>4 quarts water</ul>
        <ul>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</ul>
        <ul>1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</ul>
        <ul>½ cup chopped cilantro</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon chopped green onion</ul>
        <ul>1 ½ cups bean sprouts</ul>
        <ul>1 bunch Thai basil</ul>
        <ul>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</ul>
        <ul>¼ cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (Optional)</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</ol>
        <ol>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</ol>
        <ol>Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</ol>
        <ol>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</ol>
        <ol>When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</ol>
        <ol>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</ol>
        <ol>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</ol>
