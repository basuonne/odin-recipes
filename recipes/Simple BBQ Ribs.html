    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's it! Back to simplicity, back to country life.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>2 Â½ pounds country-style pork ribs</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons kosher salt</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon garlic powder</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
        <ul>1 cup barbeque sauce</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt, garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>While the ribs are boiling, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</ol>
        <ol>Remove ribs from the pot, and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour barbeque sauce over ribs. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</ol>
        <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</ol>
        <ol>Serve hot and enjoy!</ol>
